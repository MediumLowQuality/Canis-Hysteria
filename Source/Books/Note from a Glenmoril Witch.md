`<font face='$HandwrittenFont'><font size='18'>`Dearest Sisters,

The Coven wil remember your dedication and service. We realize Solstheim is an inhospitable place, but we go where we are needed. Anyone seeking the cure must perform the Rite of the Wolf Giver, of course.

I have prepared the following insstructions to preform this sacred rite. In the event that one of you may fall, I hope that this letter will aid the others in continuing our good work.

Gather taproot from the corpse from a spriggan and a piece of canis root from around the island.

Find a fresh sacrifice and bring them to your altar, kill them and take their heart.

Place the sacrifice's heart into a cauldron alongside the taproot and canis root. Mix the ingredients together and the heart will be imbued with the essence of the wolf.

Replace the enchanted heart back into the empty chest of your sacrifice. If all went well, the sacrifice will rise and transform into a beast.

The one who sought you out will need to dispatch the beast by themself if they want their lycantrhopy cured. Do not intervene!

If you follow these simple steps it will ensure that you will be able to sucessfully provide the cure to all who require it.
