### Taxonomy of Lycanthropic Disease

A study on the dicotomy between Sanies Lupinus and Canis Hysteria.

It is well known that there are a multitude of different strains of lycanthropic disease. There are werebears, wereboars, werelions, and even weresharks; however, the most widespread and widely known variant of lycanthropy is the werewolf. While this study will be applicible to all strains of lycanthropic disease, we will be looking especially at the werewolf as our primary case study.

If you were to ask someone on the street of the Imperial City, "What is the werewolf disease?" you will likely get the response "Well, Sanies Lupus, of course!" While Sanies Lupinus is a werewolf disease, it is not the only one. There are two variants of the disease: Sanies Lupinus and the lesser known Canis Hysteria. Depending on the strain of lycanthropy, you may hear these same variants referred to as anything from "Ursus Hysteria" and "Sanies Ursinus" for werebears to "Felis Hysteria" and "Sanies Felinus" for werelions. Regardless of the strain, these two terms are often used interchangably, but there is a real difference between the two.

Sanies Lupinus has become the most common term for werewolf disease, but it is rarely the correct one. This variant of lycanthropy can only be contracted via magical means and is most commonly transferred via some kind of spell or other curse. On the other hand, Canis Hysteria is the viral variant of lycanthropy. It is most commonly contracted by direct contact with lycanthropes.

The two variants behave very similarly. Assuming the infected did not injest lycanthrope blood directly, both have a three-day incubation period, both have the infected transform into a beast, and both leave the infected in a terrifying state of unquenchable bloodlust. It has been hypothesized that those suffering from Canies Lupinus have greater control of their inner beast, but such claims have never been substainiated.

Where the two variants are at least alike concerns their respective cures. While both diseases can be cured by conventional means during the incubation period, it becomes much harder after the infected has become a full lycanthrope. While cures are rare, it has been said that those infected in Canis Hysteria have been completely cured by undergoing certain magical rites. The most well-known of these rites is that of the "Rite of the Wolf-Giver." However, much about the rite is still shrouded in mystery. During Hiricne's Great Hunt of Solstheim in the Third Era, it was well-known that a group of Glenmoril Witches would often offer to perform this rite at the ancient Altar of Thrond to those who sought them out.

In comparison, Sanies Lupinus has no known cure beyond reversing the magical effects from the original source.

While there is much overlap between Sanies Lupinus and Canis Hysteria, they are two very distict variants of the lycanthrope disease. Sanies Lupinus is often the only term used the describe the disease despite it likely being the rarer of the two variants.
