This discussion will center on the werewolf, the most widespread and widely-known lycanthrope, though it will be applicable to all strains of lycanthropic diseases. Due to several high-profile cases in the late Third and early Fourth Eras and a series of studies by renowned healers, Sanies Lupinus is well-known and commonly believed to be responsible for all cases of lycanthropy. In reality, however, Sanies Lupinus is not the only variant that can create a werewolf. There are two main variants of the disease: Sanies Lupinus and the lesser known Canis Hysteria. Each has several strains, such as "Ursus Hysteria" and "Sanies Ursinus" , which turn the infected into werebears; "Felis Hysteria" and "Sanies Felinus" do the same for werelions. The variants are often described interchangeably, but there is a marked difference between the two. Sanies Lupinus stems from a spell or curse, and spreads only by blood. Canis Hysteria, on the other hand, is a true disease, and can be spread by any direct contact with lycanthropes.

The two variants progress similarly after initial infection. Assuming the infected did not ingest tainted blood directly, both have a three-day incubation period before the infected transforms into a beast in a terrifying state of unquenchable bloodlust, with remittent transformations ranging from once per lunar cycle to nightly. It is rumored that the Sanies Lupinus variant allows finer control of one's mind and faculties while transformed, but such claims have never been substantiated. While both diseases can be cured by conventional means during the incubation period, cures differ most after the infected has become a fully realized lycanthrope. Those infected by Canis Hysteria can be completely cured by undergoing certain magical processes, such as the "Rite of the Wolf-Giver", a ritual that a group of Glenmoril witches were known to offer to perform at the ancient Altar of Thrond on the isle of Solstheim during the Third Era. Few details of this ritual are known. In contrast, Sanies Lupinus has no known cure short of outright reversal of the curse from its original source.
