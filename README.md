When I first played Skyrim I was very excited about the return of lycanthropy, but disappointed when I learned the only way to become a werewolf it was through the Companions questline. I was expecting a cool disease system where you could contract it similar to Sanguinare Vampiris. Well, with the help of my friend Victor, we have done just that. Now, when fighting werecreatures around Skyrim, there will be a chance for you to catch Canis Hysteria, a disease that will morph into lycanthropy if not treated!

-   A new disease, Canis Hysteria, that will morph into full-blown lycanthropy if not treated.
-   An alternative way to cure your beast blood (this will only work on non-Companion werewolves).
-   New dialogue for the Companions questline to highlight your lycanthrope status.
